## Appendix: Technical Deep Dive

### Authentication Flow
```
User → Login → Spotify OAuth → PKCE Verification
     → Token → API Access → Playback Control
```

### Loop Storage Schema
```typescript
{
  userId: string,
  trackId: string,
  loops: [
    {
      id: string,
      label: string,
      start: number,  // milliseconds
      end: number,    // milliseconds
      color: string,
      enabled: boolean
    }
  ]
}
```
